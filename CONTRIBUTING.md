# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Create your own [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) of the repo
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **develop** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate
feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch. This allows me to
review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests must adhere to the [PSR-2 standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

## Unit Testing

All pull requests SHOULD be accompanied by passing unit tests and complete code
coverage. This library uses PHPUnit for testing.

IMPORTANT: If you don't know much about PHPUnit or unit testing, don't let that
stop you from contributing! We can help you write the tests or we'll write them
for you. Take the open source plunge!
